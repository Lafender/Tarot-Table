someday i'll get around to making my own tarot cards. in the meantime though, i'de made a nice thing for them i can use to play with them already made.
if you make your own cards, you can use the same code for your cards too
just make sure to name them appropriately so the javascript can find it. or just change the javascript to have your own names if your doing a wiccan deck or any other kind of deck (yugioh, card monsters, krosmaga, whatever)
what the code is it records every card drawn up until the last card is drawn (if you have a duplicate card in your deck, made sure to give it a unique name so that the deck doesn't assume you drew it already and it might fail to draw another card (if ithe duplicate is your last card)
